## Random Reordering of an Array

From an array of 10 names, when you hit the randomize button, it is supposed to randomize the order of the names.
I did this for my fantasy football draft as we wanted a randomized order days before the draft.
Ideally you should be able to input the names in the browser so that you don't have to manually change anything in the code.
Also you should be able to state how many names you are trying to randomize.
